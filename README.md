# rFrameAnimator

rFrameAnimator is a plugin [posted on the forums](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/rframeanimator-a-brand-new-animation-editor/1406100), seemingly last updated [on Aug 16 2021](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/7230947474/rFrameAnimator)

I've created this repository to fix bugs and improve the workflow in it more over time, and for easy inclusion in other projects that prefer to manage plugins manually via rojo (such as my own).
